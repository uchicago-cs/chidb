 *  chidb - a didactic relational database management system
 *
 * This module contains functions to manipulate a B-Tree file. In this context,
 * "BTree" refers not to a single B-Tree but to a "file of B-Trees" ("chidb
 * file" and "file of B-Trees" are essentially equivalent terms).
 *
 * However, this module does *not* read or write to the database file directly.
 * All read/write operations must be done through the pager module.

/* Open a B-Tree file
 *
 * This function opens a database file and verifies that the file
 * header is correct. If the file is empty (which will happen
 * if the pager is given a filename for a file that does not exist)
 * then this function will (1) initialize the file header using
 * the default page size and (2) create an empty table leaf node
 * in page 1.
 *
 * Parameters
 * - filename: Database file (might not exist)
 * - db: A chidb struct. Its bt field must be set to the newly
 *       created BTree.
 * - bt: An out parameter. Used to return a pointer to the
 *       newly created BTree.
 *
 * Return
 * - CHIDB_OK: Operation successful
 * - CHIDB_ECORRUPTHEADER: Database file contains an invalid header
 * - CHIDB_ENOMEM: Could not allocate memory
 * - CHIDB_EIO: An I/O error has occurred when accessing the file

/* Insert a new cell into a B-Tree node
 *
 * Inserts a new cell into a B-Tree node at a specified position ncell.

 *     the BTreeCell into the chidb format (refer to The chidb File Format

 *  3. Modify the cell offset array so that all values in positions >= ncell
 *     are shifted one position forward in the array. Then, set the value of
 *     position ncell to be the offset of the newly added cell.
 *
 * This function assumes that there is enough space for this cell in this node.

/* Insert a BTreeCell into a B-Tree

 * before calling chidb_Btree_insertNonFull.
 *
 * Parameters
 * - bt: B-Tree file
 * - nroot: Page number of the root node of the B-Tree we want to insert
 *          this cell in.
 * - btc: BTreeCell to insert into B-Tree

/* Insert a BTreeCell into a non-full B-Tree node
 *
 * chidb_Btree_insertNonFull inserts a BTreeCell into a node that is
 * assumed not to be full (i.e., does not require splitting). If the
 * node is a leaf node, the cell is directly added in the appropriate
 * position according to its key. If the node is an internal node, the
 * function will determine what child node it must insert it in, and
 * calls itself recursively on that child node. However, before doing so
 * it will check if the child node is full or not. If it is, then it will
 * have to be split first.
 *
 * Parameters
 * - bt: B-Tree file
 * - nroot: Page number of the root node of the B-Tree we want to insert
 *          this cell in.
 * - btc: BTreeCell to insert into B-Tree

/* Split a B-Tree node

 *   cell is a table leaf cell, the median cell is moved too)
 * - Add a cell to the parent (which, by definition, will be an
 *   internal page) with the median key and the page number of M.

 * - bt: B-Tree file
 * - npage_parent: Page number of the parent node
 * - npage_child: Page number of the node to split
 * - parent_ncell: Position in the parent where the new cell will
